The purpose of this github is to provide a solution to the biggest problem currently in the forex market, and that issue is algo trading!
Most forex brokers do not have their own custom api and only provide their own version of Metatrader 4 for traders to interface with.
Metatrader 4/Metatrader 5 is an outdated windows xp era forex trading software that is rather difficult to use AND espically frustating to program for!!!!!!!!!!!
The journey of becoming a compentent forex algo trader was brutal(devesating at times), required lots of trial and error, and difficult.
However, the problems i and many others in my shoes have faced can be solved when using Python as a base programing language instead of the garbage MQL4 
(Metatrader 4) programing languaage.
Assuming you have a stratedgy in mind to test or have a profitable trading stratedgy written in Python, these github filese will allow users to place traders very
simply to Metatrader 4. Futhermore, i am assuming that most people i am helping here are new to programing or algo trading in general so i organized everything to be simple to understand

How it works?
I have included programs for; Also configured CONTAINORIZED and PORTABLE versions Python3 and Metatrader 4 enviroments to demonstrate an easy solution to send orders to mt4 using Python
In simple terms, you just need to download the files and run the programs. Due to the nature of these portable enviroments i have configured, there is no need for any installing of any kind.
It is simple to use and possibly a great way for new people to get into forex or algo trading. 
You can even run the files on a USB or in a Dropbox folder giving many computers you own the ability to algo trade without the need of installing python or metatrader.

Just load spyder.exe and terminal.exe and you are ready to start algo trading.

What is the catch?
Only works on windows only. You can use wine to emulate on mac/linux but suppoort is hit or miss.
